                        <li>Hi, so they asked me to hold an inspirational talk about A.I. Well, that's easy. It's very easy to inspire about A.I. Why?</li>
                        <li>Because A.I. is like MAGIC. And there are few things that inspire better than Magic. I love magic, read a lot of fantasy books, play fantasy games. There's always magic.</li>
                        <li>But Why is A.I. MAGIC?</li>
                        <li>Because magic most often has 2 properties:
                            <ul>
                                <li>It is marvelous.</li>
                                <li>And we cannot fully explain it.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Just like A.I. I bet you remember the first time you tried chatgpt and if you're anything like me, you were amazed what it could do. Every day still I see new things that I did not expect, or hold possible, done by A.I. So it's marvelous. And, due to the nature of language models how genetic algorithms and neural networks work, we cannot fully explain them. We are continously researching why and how this works. Magic!</li>

                        <p>So, What is an LLM? How are they created?</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The high-level process of creating an A.I. Model is straightforward:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>You need data</li>
                                    <li>Label that data</li>
                                    <li>Train a model on that data</li>
                                    <li>Use the model to make predictions on similar cases</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Example: To create a risk model predicting company defaults:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Gather information about existing companies (revenue, costs, size, etc.)</li>
                                    <li>Label which companies went into default and which did not</li>
                                    <li>Train a model on this dataset</li>
                                    <li>Use the model to produce risk scores for future companies</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>This is called supervised training. The more data you have, the better your model performs.</li>
                            <li>Getting labeled data is expensive:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>If it costs 5 cents to label one record, 1 million records cost $50,000</li>
                                    <li>Double-checking each record would cost $100,000</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <ul>
                            <li>An LLM is a specific model trained on natural language sources, which allows for unsupervised training.</li>
                            <li>You do not have to label the data; labels are inferred from the training data itself.</li>
                            <li>Text is everywhere, making it easy to gather enormous datasets for training.</li>
                            <li>With access to vast data (like the entire public internet) and the resources for unsupervised training, we can now create large language models.</li>
                            <li>ChatGPT, for example, is an LLM trained on a diverse range of internet text.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>So what goes on under the hood? Most of the models we use today are called "next token generators." Given an input, they use probabilistic calculations to generate an output.</li>
                            <li>What does that mean? For example, if I ask you your favorite world cuisine, you might answer "Vietnamese." If I ask you again a minute later, you'll likely give the same answer. A model, however, might give a different answer the second time, because its responses are based on probability, not certainty.</li>
                            <li>The nature of these models is probabilistic, not deterministic. That's why it's impossible to guarantee 100% predictable answers. There are techniques to improve consistency, but it's important to understand that this technology is fundamentally based on probability calculations.</li>
                            <li>If the models were always completely random, they would be useless. Fortunately, there are parameters you can adjust, such as "top-p" and "temperature," to control the randomness. (Demo these settings.)</li>

                            <li>Now you have a high-level idea of how LLMs work under the hood—they're probability machines. Because of their immense size, they can seemingly do everything.</li>
                            <li>But what are they good at? And what are they not good at? Let's explore that for a bit…</li>
                            <li>LLMs excel where both the input and output are words, and the rules are fuzzy.</li>
                            <li>But they can also do images right? Right, but they use different models for that. When you ask ChatGPT to generate an image, it's actually using a separate model trained on visual data.</li>
                            <li>To keeps things simple, we'll stick to Language models. <li>                                
                            </li>Think of an LLM like that one friend who’s read everything, speaks eloquently, and will confidently answer anything you ask… but sometimes makes things up without realizing it. The trick is knowing when to trust that friend, and when to check the facts.</li>
                            <li>Some very successful AI tools include:

                        <li><strong>LLMs are not calculators or truth machines.</strong></li>
                        <li>They do not <em>know</em> facts; they <em>predict</em> likely answers based on patterns in data.</li>
                        <li>LLMs are excellent storytellers, but not always reliable truth-tellers. This can be hard to get used to.</li>
                        <li>We are used to computers giving precise, correct answers—like calculators in math class. If a calculator gives a wrong answer, it's a bug!</li>
                        <li>With LLMs, for the first time, we must accept that a computer might be wrong or uncertain.</li>
                        <li>Older LLMs (like GPT-2) might confidently answer questions like "What time is it?" with a random, incorrect time.</li>
                        <li>LLMs understand your question and generate a syntactically correct answer, but it may not be factually accurate.</li>
                        <li> modern models seem to have overcome these limitations, but actually, many of them are not solved by creating better models, but by  system prompts and software around the model. </li>

                        <li>Thousands of AI tools launched daily</li>
                        <li>Key question: Where is my data going?</li>
                        <li>2 kinds of data you should keep in mind</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>GDPR and Personal Identifiable Information</li>

                    <aside class="notes">
                        <ul>
                            <li>So, we've seen that it can actually do a lot. Let your imagination run wild for a moment. I'm sure you can think of at least 10 things it could do to improve the work process of you or your colleagues.</li>
                            <li>Well, you're not alone :) There are thousands of AI tools that could help you in your work and new ones are launched every day that could make tedious tasks easier, help you brainstorm, generate text or images etc. Take notes, summarize documents etc etc…</li>
                            <li>But which can you use? and more importantly, why?</li>
                            <li>I'll start saying that I'm not your legal officer, nor do I pretend to be an expert in the rules and regulation concerning data. So the disclaimer I'll give you is "If you doubt, check it with the right people."</li>
                            <li>Having said that, there are some principles you should keep in mind. Things you should always keep in mind when using AI tooling.</li>
                            <li>Whenever considering a tool, you should always ask: Where is my data going and what will it be used for?</li>
                            <li>Not always easy to answer, when in doubt, verify with the part of your organisation that can help you with that.</li>
                            <li>See, when you go to ChatGPT.com, you are talking to a version of a LLM. This means that this model runs in the public cloud, probably in one of the huge data centers in the US. OpenAI is a US company. So whatever you send in will probably go to the US.</li>
                            <li>GDPR considerations:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>PII (Personal Identifiable Information) - personal data. You own your own data, so you're allowed to send in that, though I would strongly advise against it.</li>
                                    <li>PII of others - this is where you need to be careful</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Proprietary data, like source code. You cannot publicly share source code of our products.</li>

                            <li>Well, firstly we work with customer data. This data often is not ours, so also not for us to publicly share. Also, it might contain PII, so for most use cases in our software, we cannot use public models.</li>

                                    <li>Simple (just link to API, and start building!)</li>
                                    <li>Controlled environment</li>

                            <li>Azure deployments example - we can deploy models in controlled environments</li>
                            <li>An alternative is local deployment of a model. There are open source models out there that you can deploy locally. Meta has a famous one called "OLlama" which you can even deploy on your laptop. You cannot deploy the huge models powering ChatGPT or Claude. These are closed models, only the backing companies offer them, and they usually partner with a cloud provider to support  more private options.</li>
                            <li>keep in mind that for private deployments, you're also responsible for maintenance. keeping it up to date, and maybe more complex things like MLOPS.</li>
                            <li>This is a different ball game and something that you should invest in if you want to take it to PRD.</li>

                            <li>So, what can AI actually do in applications? Let me show you some concrete examples that are already working in production today.</li>
                            <li>Assistant - Think of ChatGPT embedded in your app. Users can ask questions and get interactive insights about their data. Instead of static reports, they get conversational analysis.</li>
                            <li>Analyze documents or images - Upload a contract, invoice, or medical scan, and AI extracts structured data automatically. No more manual data entry!</li>
                            <li>Reason over data - AI doesn't just show you numbers, it suggests what to do. "Your sales are down 15% in region X, consider increasing marketing budget there."</li>
                            <li>Translate - Real-time translation of user input. Your Dutch app suddenly works in 100+ languages without you writing a single translation.</li>
                            <li>Summarize - Long documents become digestible summaries. Legal contracts, research papers, meeting transcripts - all condensed to key points.</li>
                            <li>Generate - Create new content on demand. Product descriptions, email responses, code snippets, marketing copy - AI generates it based on your context.</li>
                            <li>The magic is that these aren't theoretical anymore. They're working in real applications today. The question isn't "can AI do this?" but "which of these would help your users most?"</li>

                            <li>Now let's talk about how to actually build AI into your applications. There are several architectural approaches, and I always recommend: START SIMPLE.</li>
                            <li>START SIMPLE - Begin by building something around a prompt. Don't overcomplicate it. Take user input, send it to an AI model, return the response. That's it. You'll be surprised how much value you can create with just this.</li>
                            <li>Need advanced context? Try RAG - Retrieval-Augmented Generation. This is when you need your AI to have knowledge beyond what it was trained on. But warning - RAG can get difficult. Not because of the AI part, but because of retrieval. Good retrieval is not trivial. This has always been difficult - it's the domain of search engines like Google.</li>
                            <li>Give your AI capabilities - Let it use tools. Let the AI determine when and how to use them. Instead of you deciding the workflow, the AI figures out what tools it needs and when to use them.</li>
                            <li>Agentic AI - These usually work in multi-agent systems and execute complex tasks. Complex does not equal difficult. Complex just means it takes multiple steps to complete. So you need to plan before execution. Planning is an important aspect of agentic AI.</li>
                            <li>Example: Claude Code - This is agentic AI in action. It can write code, run tests, debug errors, read documentation, and even commit to git. It plans its approach and uses different tools as needed.</li>
                            <li>The key takeaway: Start with a simple prompt, then add complexity only when you need it. Don't build a space shuttle when a bicycle will do the job.</li>
                        </ul>

                        </li>

                            <li>So how are costs calculated? By Token.</li>
                            <li>AI uses compute. This is the capacity necessary to perform operations. I mentioned that most of the popular models we use nowadays are next token generators.</li>
                            <li>Pay per Token - smallest unit of information a model processes. Small words, or part of a word. like the bartender, might be 3 tokens, might be 4. Interesting stuff, challenge you to dive into this.</li>
                            <li>Sounds simple? But it gets complex quickly. Larger models use more compute, so processing a token is more expensive.</li>
                            <li>How big a token is varies per model. Depending on model architecture and design choices.</li>
                            <li>Then there is Multi-modality. If a token is part of a word, how much is an image??? This is done by slicing it up in tiles, but only after reducing its size.</li>
                            <li>There is also reasoning. In which multiple requests are done to the model after each step.</li>
                            <li>For complex use cases, almost impossible to predict.</li>
                            <li>Best way is empirical. Try, check tokens used. Calculate.</li>

                            <li>Some examples of these patterns include few-shot, chain-of-thought, tree-of-thoughts, and flipped interaction. Look them up—interesting stuff!</li>
                            <li>I'll quickly dive into a few of them: Few shots, Chain of Thought, and Flipped interaction.</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Few-Shot Pattern:</strong> This is like teaching by demonstration — instead of telling the model the rule, you just show it a couple of examples.</li>
                            <li>Works well when you need consistent formatting or when you're nudging the model toward a specific style.</li>
                            <li>Example: give a few Q&A pairs in your desired tone, and the model will continue in the same style.</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Chain of Thought:</strong> Back in 2023, long ago in A.I. terms, they were searching for how to unlock reasoning capabilities in these models.</li>                            
                            <li>So, they found that by just telling the model to "think step by step" - by explicitly asking the model to reason step by step, you reduce errors in logic-heavy tasks.</li>
                            <li>Great for debugging code, solving word problems, or explaining technical reasoning. It makes the thought process visible — which also makes it easier for humans to catch mistakes.</li>
                            <li>This is also built in, in the system prompts of modern models. When you ask GPT 5 a question requiring multiple steps to answer, you can see it working through the problem step by step.</li>

                            <li><strong>Flipped Interaction:</strong> Another great example of a prompting pattern is Flipped interaction. When prompting, you're probably used to asking questions and getting answers, right?</li>
                            <li>But what if you don't know the questions? What if you need an answer in a domain you know nothing about?</li>
                            <li>Instead of jumping straight to an answer, the model plays back like a consultant: "Wait, I need more info first."</li>
                            <li>Very effective  in domains you do not know much about.</li>
                            <li>This is also one of the patterns which is built into the system prompts of larger models. Anyone of you ever tried Deep Research? For instance from ChatGPT? You can ask it a question and it will spend like 5-20 minutes researching, reasoning and compiling an answer.</li>
                            <li>If you ask it a short question, it will almost always reply by asking you return questions. Because deep research takes a lot of time from the model, and time for you, and costs way more tokens than a regular question. So it would be a waste if it didn't understand your question correctly, so it will try to get it clear.</li>

                            <li>Prompts are the way to communicate with an LLM. But what not everyone realizes yet is that prompts are THE way to communicate with an LLM. There is no other. So if you build an application which uses an LLM to perform a task, you need a prompt, natural language, in your software. The prompt contains the question you want the LLM to answer, so it will contain business logic. Prompts in your software are called system prompts.</li>
                            <li>Some system prompts enrich user input for instance in a chatbot. Some system prompts are completely invisible to the user, for instance, when your app does not have direct user interface. For example, we have an app, analysing financial documents.</li>
                            <li>Used in this way, prompts are not so different from the source code of your application. My advice here is to treat it as such.</li>

                            <li>Prompt attacks pose multiple risks for applications; some are more devastating than others. Here are just a few of them:</li>
                            <li><strong>Remote code or tool execution</strong> - For applications with access to powerful tools, bad actors can invoke unauthorized code or tool execution. Imagine if someone finds a way to get your system to execute an SQL query that reveals all your users' sensitive data or sends unauthorized emails to your customers. As another example, let's say you use AI to help you run a research experiment, which involves generating experiment code and executing that code on your computer. An attacker can find ways to get the model to generate malicious code to compromise your system.</li>
                            <li><strong>Data leaks</strong> - Bad actors can extract private information about your system and your users.</li>
                            <li><strong>Social harms</strong> - AI models help attackers gain knowledge and tutorials about dangerous or criminal activities, such as making weapons, evading taxes, and exfiltrating personal information.</li>
                            <li><strong>Misinformation</strong> - Attackers might manipulate models to output misinformation to support their agenda.</li>
                            <li><strong>Service interruption and subversion</strong> - This includes giving access to a user who shouldn't have access, giving high scores to bad submissions, or rejecting a loan application that should've been approved. A malicious instruction that asks the model to refuse to answer all the questions can cause service interruption.</li>
                            <li><strong>Brand risk</strong> - Having politically incorrect and toxic statements next to your logo can cause a PR crisis, such as when Google AI search urged users to eat rocks or when Microsoft's chatbot Tay spat out racist comments. Even though people might understand that it's not your intention to make your application offensive, they can still attribute the offenses to your lack of care about safety or just incompetence.</li>
                             <li>Very interesting stuff, this. I do not have enough time to go into this in detail, but I'll give you some sources at the end of the presentation which you can use to dive further into this.</li>

                            <li>We've covered a lot of ground today - from understanding how LLMs work to implementing them in applications and crafting effective prompts.</li>
                            <li>Now let's wrap up with some practical advice you can take back to your hackaton.</li>
                            <li>first of all, you can forget more than half of what I just told you. For the hackaton, don't worry about the limitations and the risks.</li>
                            <li>you're not building a production system, you're exploring possibilities!</li>
                            <li>GDPR? Data privacy? Security? These are all solvable problems that shouldn't constrain your creativity.</li>
                            <li>The whole point of a hackathon is discovery - what works, what doesn't, what could be amazing if we had unlimited resources?</li>                                                        
                            <li>The best hackathon projects often come from teams that ignored all practical limitations and focused purely on "what if we could...?"</li>

                            <li>This is where non-technical team members really shine - creating the story and presentation that makes your hackathon project compelling.</li>
                            <li><strong>Visual Content:</strong> You can create professional-looking mockups with DALL-E, design interfaces in Figma with AI assistance, generate demo videos with Runway or Synthesia. No design experience needed!</li>
                            <li><strong>Written Content:</strong> AI tools can help you craft compelling pitch decks, write user stories, create business cases. Gamma and Beautiful.AI can even design your entire presentation for you.</li>
                            <li>The key insight: In hackathons, presentation often matters more than the technical implementation. A well-told story with great visuals can win over a technically perfect but poorly presented solution.</li>

                            <li>For developers, the key is to start simple. The models at your disposal have grown so powerful, By far, most AI applications use just the power of prompting to get what you need.</li>                            
                            <li><strong>Quick Start:</strong> Get API keys from whatever model provider you want to use. This can be a serviced solution like Azure Foundry, AWS Bedrock or Google Cloud but also a public one, by directly linking to the ChatGPT or Claude API's. It's a hackaton. </li>
                            <li>Use frameworks like LangChain for common patterns. Streamlit and Gradio are amazing for quick UI demos.</li>
                            <li><strong>Architecture:</strong> Start with the simplest possible flow - user input, API call, display result. JSON mode gives you structured data. Vector databases are great for RAG but not essential for every project.</li>                            
                            <li>Remember: GitHub Copilot and other AI coding tools can significantly speed up your development during the hackathon.</li>

                    <p>And that’s where we’ll leave it; no Q&A, just a question to take with you:</p>
                    <p>Is prompt engineering truly a new programming language… or just a clever way of getting what we want from a black box?</p>
                    <p>We’re not giving you the answer — that’s for you to keep thinking about, debating over drinks, or arguing about in Slack.</p>
                    <p>You can scan the QR code to access our slides, and if you want to dive deeper, we’ll be outside with a drink.</p>
                    <p>Or join the discussion in the #topiconf-prompt-engineering Slack channel. Let’s keep the conversation going!</p>
